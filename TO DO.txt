Error Handling: Ensure that all potential error scenarios are handled appropriately in both the BookCreate and BookCreateProcess functions. It's important to provide clear error messages and handle errors gracefully.

Code Organization: Consider organizing your code into packages and modules based on functionality. This can improve readability and maintainability, especially as your application grows.

Dependency Injection: If possible, consider using dependency injection to inject dependencies such as the HTTP client or database connection into your functions. This can make your code more modular and easier to test.

Unit Testing: Write unit tests to verify the behavior of your functions, especially the BookCreateProcess function. Unit tests can help catch bugs early and ensure that your code behaves as expected in different scenarios.
